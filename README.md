__Expo__ is the easiest way to start building a new React Native application. It helps to start our react-native project without installing native build tools like Xcode or Android Studio.

Install expo globally using:
```
npm install -g expo-cli
```

Navigate to the folder where we want to setup the react-native project. Then execute following lines.
```
expo init AwesomeProject

cd AwesomeProject
npm start
```
This will create a project named _AwesomeProject_. `npm start` will start the project and give us a QR code to scan by Expo App. Expo App can be downloaded from play store and is used to run our react-native projects.
